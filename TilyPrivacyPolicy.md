Terms and Conditions (Tily)

By downloading or using the Tily app (at tily.app) and placing an order, you agree to these Terms of Service.  Your use of our services – including uploading photos or images to be printed on 30 × 30 cm tiles – constitutes acceptance of these Terms .  Tily provides a tile-printing service: you supply the image, we print it on a tile (a 30 cm × 30 cm × 3 mm panel), and ship it to you. The tiles are intended solely for personal, decorative use (e.g. home decor) and not for resale or mass distribution.  We do not produce mass copies of any design for events or commercial purposes.

User Content and Responsibilities

You are entirely responsible for the content of any image or photo you upload.  You represent and warrant that you own or have all necessary rights and permissions to use the image(s) you provide. Tily does not pre-screen images, so the choice of content is yours – you alone are responsible for ensuring it does not infringe any third-party rights, violate any laws, or contain prohibited material.  For example, you agree not to upload or print images that are unlawful, hateful, abusive, pornographic, defamatory, or otherwise offensive  .  You also agree not to use our service to impersonate or mislead others (for instance, by presenting a printed tile as belonging to another company or adding unauthorized logos)  .  You grant Tily a limited license to print and ship the tile you order, but retain all other rights to your content. In consideration of using our service, you agree to release, indemnify and hold Tily harmless from any claims, damages or losses arising from your use of the service or any content you submit  .  We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order if we believe the content is illegal or violates these Terms.

Orders, Pricing and Payment

When you place an order in the app, it is processed as an Apple in-app purchase.  All payments are handled by Apple’s App Store billing system: we do not collect or see your payment details directly.  By confirming a purchase, you authorize Apple to charge your selected payment method.  All transactions are subject to Apple’s terms and conditions, and you must follow Apple’s procedures for billing or refund issues .  Prices are as stated in the app at the time of purchase.  For customers in the European Union, displayed prices include VAT.  If you are outside the EU, any local sales tax, import duty or similar fees are your responsibility .  Once an order is placed and paid, it is considered final, except as provided below under Returns and Refunds.

Shipping and Delivery

Tily ships printed tiles worldwide in accordance with this policy.  We aim to ship your order within 72 hours of payment.  Delivery is fully covered for countries within the European Union.  For orders outside the EU, you may be required to pay additional import fees or taxes imposed by your local authorities (these charges are your responsibility during pickup or delivery) .  You must provide complete and accurate shipping information; if required information is missing or invalid, your order may be put on hold until resolved.  We will provide a tracking number if available, but we are not responsible for the courier’s delivery performance or for delays caused by events beyond our control (such as customs delays, postal strikes, natural disasters, etc.) .  In particular, Tily is not liable for non-delivery or late delivery of the product if it results from factors outside our control .  In rare cases of force majeure, we will notify you and take reasonable steps to fulfill your order as soon as practicable.

Returns and Refunds

We strive for 100% satisfaction, but because each tile is custom-made, all sales are final unless the tile is defective or damaged during shipping.  If your tile arrives damaged or defective, please follow these steps:
	•	Contact us immediately with photos of the damage and your order number.
	•	Ship the damaged tile back to us at the address provided by our support team.  (We recommend using a trackable shipping method, as we cannot be responsible for lost returns .)
	•	Inspection: Once we receive the returned tile, we will inspect it to verify the damage or defect.
	•	Resolution: If the damage is confirmed, we will either refund you in full or replace the tile, at our option.  Refunds (for the price paid) will be processed within 24 hours of confirmation .

You are responsible for the return shipping cost of a damaged tile, but we may, at our discretion, offer a coupon code to help offset that expense.  If the damage to the tile cannot be verified upon inspection, we reserve the right to refuse a refund.  Apart from damaged or defective items, Tily does not accept returns of custom-printed tiles.

Privacy and Data Retention

Your privacy is important to us.  We collect only the data needed to fulfill your order (such as your uploaded images, name, address, and contact information).  This information is used solely for order processing and delivery, and will never be published or shared publicly.  If you consent to share your device’s location in the app (e.g. to autofill address forms), we will use that data only to aid shipment preparation and will never share it with third parties . You may disable location services at any time.

We retain your personal information (including your images and order details) in a private cloud for up to 180 days after your purchase, to allow handling any technical issues or inquiries. After 180 days, your data and images are permanently deleted from our system .  You have the right to request deletion of your data at any time by contacting us.  Except as required by law, we do not disclose your private information to anyone.  Our full privacy practices (including any updates) are described in our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms by reference  .

Intellectual Property

Tily owns all rights, title and interest in the app, website and related materials, including all trademarks, logos and content (excluding the images you upload).  You may use our app only for the purposes expressly permitted by these Terms.  You may not copy, modify, or distribute our intellectual property without permission.  You agree not to remove or alter any of our proprietary notices or logos on the products you receive . If you believe your intellectual property rights have been infringed by content available on our app or website, please contact us (via the in-app or website contact form) with a notice in accordance with the DMCA or similar laws .

Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability

THE TILY APP AND SERVICE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.  While we take care to produce high-quality tiles, we do not guarantee the service will meet every expectation.  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TILY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or quality of images).  We do not warrant that the service will be error-free or uninterrupted.

Limitation of Liability: In no event will Tily (or its officers, employees or partners) be liable for indirect, incidental, punitive or consequential damages (including loss of profits, loss of data or loss of use) arising from your use of the app or products .  Our total liability to you for any claim arising from these Terms or your order will not exceed the amount you paid for the product at issue .  This limitation applies even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.  Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of certain warranties or limitations of liability; in such cases, our liability will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

Product Safety: Our tiles are decorative items meant to be hung on walls using appropriate hardware.  You must follow any provided instructions for mounting them.  Tily will not be liable for any injury or property damage caused by improper installation or if a tile falls from your wall .  In short, use common sense in handling the product.

Modification of Terms

Tily reserves the right to update or change these Terms at any time.  We will notify you of significant changes by in-app notice, email (if provided), or a notice on our website .  Continued use of the app after any revision indicates your acceptance of the new Terms .

Governing Law

These Terms and your use of the Tily app are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Spain (European Union).  Any disputes arising under these Terms will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Spanish courts, except where your local consumer rights require otherwise.

We may also provide an email address or phone number on our site for direct support.
